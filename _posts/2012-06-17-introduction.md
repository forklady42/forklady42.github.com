title: Life as a twenty-something is like studying abroad
---

Since graduating college a year ago, I've considered starting a blog.
I kept a one while <a href="http://conservationofbears.blogspot.com/"> studying 
abroad in Ecuador</a>. That blog was a great way to reflect on my trip and share
my adventures with friends. Every so often, I enjoy returning to that blog to
review my thought processes and the highlights from the term.

Studying abroad was an adventure: meeting new people, discovering different cultures,
even running into a mother bear and her cub. Students are encouraged to explore the
unknown and have adventures while studying abroad. Yet, that does not make the rest
of life any less of an adventure, even when we don't highlight it. Since graduating
a year ago, I moved to a region of the US that I had never visited, much less lived.
I've laughed, fumed, and compromised while working to build a community with 
housemates from different backgrounds. I've adjusted to living in a city and taken 
advantage of free days at museums.

Also, like studying abroad, I'm still learning. I've enjoyed public lectures at UW
and talks at Town Hall. My enjoyment of algorithms in college and discussing economics
with friends led me to register for classes on <a href="http://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>.
Even making this website has been an experiment and taught me new skills.

As I continue to explore and learn, my thoughts and perspective continue to morph.
This blog will document where I've been and share my experiences and insights with you.
I hope this blog will also remind that I'm still on adventure and have much exploring to do.
