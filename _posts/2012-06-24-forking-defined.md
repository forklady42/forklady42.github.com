Forks are my quirk. As explained under the forks tab of this website,
my obsession with forks began with a lunchtime photo at a digital photography 
camp. I believe that forks represent me not only as objects in my collection 
but through the various definitions.

<blockquote>
<h4>Fork</h4>
1. (n. OED) an implement with two or more prongs used for lifting food to the mouth
or holding with cutting.<br>

2. (n. OED) the point where something, especially a road or river, divides
into two parts; either of two forked parts.<br>

3. (n. Wikipedia) when software developers take a copy of source code 
from one software package and start independent development on it, creating 
a distinct piece of software.
</blockquote>

The first definition is probably the first one to jump into your mind when someone
mentions fork. In addition to collecting the objects themselves, I'm passionate
about delicious, sustainable food. As a leader of the Slow Food Club at my
college, I'd often get together with other members to walk to the farmer's market,
pick raspberries, or prepare a four course meal. I love baking anything from
cardamom bread to Parisian macarons, zwieback to blueberry peach pies. As much as
I enjoy the process and the tasty results, I always look forward to surprising friends
and acquaintances.

I like to think that the second definition applies to me as well. Of course,
forks in paths brings Robert Frost's well-known poem to my mind. I try to chart my own
course or follow untrodden paths.
As a bit counterphobic, I push myself to do things I'm frightened of. Whether it is
hiking above 15,000 ft or moving to across the country, my choices occasionally surprise my
friends and family.

The last definition relates to software development. I first began programming when
I took computer science in high school. My school required it, but because I associated
the subject with gamers, something that I most markedly was not, I put it off until 
my final term. Given my limited knowledge of the computer science, I was delighted
to discover that it was mostly logic problem solving. I enjoyed the class enough to 
take computer science classes throughout college, even arguing my way into Algorithms
when I didn't have one of the prerequisites. In the past year, I've played around with
new languages and small projects. I'm planning to become more involved in open source 
projects and look forward to working on various forks.

From cooking delicious food to venturing down unknown paths to coding, forks 
are a cross-representation of me.
