Approximation algorithms for NP complete problems were one of 
my favorite topics in my college computer science classes. Metric 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">TSP</a> 
is one of the classic approximation algorithms. In metric TSP, you are
given a set of <em>n</em> cities and non-zero distances <em>d</em>[<em>i,j</sub></em>]
between cities, such that the triangle inequality holds and the distance 
from city <em>i</em> to city <em>j</em> is the same as the distance from
city <em>j</em> to city <em>i</em>. The goal is to find an ordering of the 
cities such that the total distance traveling between them is minimized.

It is possible to find a 3/2-approximation of metric TSP in polynomial time:

Let <em>T</em> be the minimum spanning tree of the complete graph of all <em>n</em>
cities with <em>d</em>[<em>i,j</em>] as the weight of the edge <i,j>.

Let <em>O</em> be the set of all nodes (i.e. cities) <em>u</em> with odd degree in <em>T</em>.

|<em>O</em>| must be even. Each edge in <em>T</em> adds 1 to the degree of the 
two nodes. Therefore, the total degree of all nodes in <em>T</em> must 
be even. All nodes <em>v</em> in <em>T</em> but not in <em>O</em> have even 
degree, so the sum of their degrees is even. Thus, the sum of the degree 
of all nodes <em>u</em> in <em>O</em> must be even. Since the degree of each 
<em>u</em> is odd, the total degree can only be even if |<em>O</em>| is even.

Given that |<em>O</em>| is even, there must be a perfect matching of nodes in
<em>O</em>. Let <em>P</em> be a minimum cost perfect matching for <em>O</em>, and
take <em>OPT</em> as the cost of the optimal tour through all nodes.

Claim: cost of <em>P</em> is less than or equal to 1/2<em>OPT</em>.

By definition, <em>OPT</em> is the cost of the cheapest tour of all nodes.
