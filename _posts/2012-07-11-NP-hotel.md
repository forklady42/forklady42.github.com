excerpt: A few months ago, I was strolling through Seattle's International District when I looked up to see a building proclaiming to be the NP Hotel. Maybe it's where traveling salesmen spend the night when they choose a suboptimal path.

A few months ago, I was strolling through Seattle's International 
District when I looked up to see a building proclaiming to be the 
NP Hotel. Maybe it's where traveling salesmen spend the night 
when they choose a suboptimal path.

Approximation algorithms for NP complete problems were one of 
my favorite topics in my college computer science classes. Solving  the metric 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">traveling saleman problem (TSP)</a> 
with minimum spanning trees is one of the classic approximation algorithms. In metric TSP, you are
given a set of <em>n</em> cities and non-zero distances <em>d</em>[<em>i,j</sub></em>]
between cities, such that the triangle inequality holds and the distance 
from city <em>i</em> to city <em>j</em> is the same as the distance from
city <em>j</em> to city <em>i</em>. The goal is to find an ordering of the 
cities such that the total distance traveling between them is minimized.

It is possible to find a 3/2-approximation of metric TSP in polynomial time, as
proven in <a href="/images/mTSP.pdf">my notes</a>. The algorithm takes advantage 
of several properities of graphs, including minimum spanning trees and minimum 
cost perfect matching, to help the saleman choose a path quickly and wisely. 
Still, if there are a large number of cities on his list, he might want to plan 
to crash at the NP Hotel tonight.
