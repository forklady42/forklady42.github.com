Sally Ride's death yesterday prompted me to listen to 
<a href="https://apps.carleton.edu/events/convocations/audio_video/?item_id=180047">
this convocation by her</a> at Carleton College in 2006. She clearly
is an inspiration as the first American woman in space and an
astounding scientist, but what strikes me most is her committment
to mentoring girls and keeping the door to science open to them.

Women in science is a hot topic. Earlier this month, NPR 
ran a story about <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/07/12/156664337/stereotype-threat-why-women-quit-science-jobs?ps=cprs">
how the stereotype threat can cause women to leave science</a>.
Simply being around male coworkers can remind women that 
they're supposedly worse at math and then live into that 
stereotype by underperforming. Stereotypes reinforce themselves 
making it even harder for women to succeed. About a year ago,
I heard Joshua Aronson speak about his reasearch on the stereotype
threat. One of my favorite of his studies is of an upper level
math class at the University of Texas. The class was prodominately
male with a handful of women. In one section of the course, the professor
introduced the normally saying that he had been giving the test 
for 25 years and that the test accurately predicted success in math.
In the other section, he added that in the 25 years he had never
seen a gender gap on the results. In the first section, the women 
performed on par with the men, but in the second section with the 
stereotype threat removed, the women trounced the males. The stereotype
threat had kept them back so that appeared simply good rather than outstanding.

If only the most gifted women make it to upper level college math courses,
many great minds and passionate thinkers are left along the way. 
In her talk at Carleton, Sally Ride pointed out that in 
3rd and 4th grade, just as many girls enjoy science as boys do.
Yet in middle school, girls turn away. I was lucky to have
remarkable female science teachers in 4th and 6th grade. They 
made science interactive and fun and yes, even cool. They were
clear that science was wide open for me should I choose to pursue it.
These teachers and other role models kept me interested in science 
during an age when many girls become disengaged. 

Sally Ride's closing anecdote (38:00 to 41:00) is a particular treat
and shows the impact we can have on younger generations. It also reminds 
me that while girls need role models in science, we need role models 
for children of all backgrounds, in terms of race, gender identity, 
sexual orientation, culture, and socioeconomic background. All children should 
be able to dream of reaching Mars, discovering life at the bottom of the ocean,
or finding a cure to cancer.

Thank you, Sally Ride for being such a role model and inspiration 
to all who reach for the stars.
