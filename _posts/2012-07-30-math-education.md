Yesterday, the NY Times published <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/opinion/sunday/is-algebra-necessary.html">this opinion piece</a> questioning whether or not
algebra should be an enforced standard in public education and
colleges. While I certainly agree that math education needs 
reform and emphasize statistics and math inherent to computer programming, I am not convinced that we need 
to remove algebra from our standard curriculum.

Although most statistics classes do not derive their full set of
equations and thus students do not need to know the necessary linear 
algebra, they still need basic algebra skills to manipulate the equations
and understand the variables. Similarly, a strong gasp of variables is
critical for computer programming. Although variables in programming
function differently than in algebra (e.g. x=x+1 is nonsensical in math),
understanding how to algebraically manipulate variables and what 
it means to be a variable is critical to basic programming.

Of course, I am not an expert on education policy-that would be
my sister. I am also biased towards math. As a math lover and
physics devotee, I rely upon math every day. It is possible that not 
everyone needs as rigorous a background in algebra as is currently 
demanded. However, I remain wary about removing the very basics 
of algebra from curriculum.
