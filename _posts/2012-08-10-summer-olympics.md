The past couple of weeks have been filled with jaw-dropping aerials, hair-splitting hundredths of a second, and feats of endurance. Now, the summer Olympics are winding down. Some of my favorite coverage
of the London Olympics has been The New York Times' "One Race, 
Every Medalist" ever series.

In the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/05/sports/olympics/the-100-meter-dash-one-race-every-medalist-ever.html">men's 100 meter sprint</a>,
Usain Bolt topped his 2008 time by six hundredths of a second for a
time of 9.63 seconds.

Looking at the graph of the 100 meter sprint men's medalists since 1896 (20 second mark), 
it appears to be exponential. Of course, it you throw out 1896, a linear fit 
would be possible. The difference in times does seem to have diminished recently. However, 
that doesn't necessarily mean that we've reached an asymptote. There are 
several points on the graph where it appears to level out until someone breaks 
that barrier. Usain Bolt has started a new tier on the graph and if he continues 
to run, I imagine that the time will continue to shrink.

Three seconds is not insignificant in the 100 meter sprint. 9.6 seconds is
almost a 25% improvement over 12.6 seconds, the slowest time of any of the
medalists. Still, as The New York Times points out the difference is only
3 seconds. All of these medalists are incredibly fast, even now. Every 
Olympian is a highly skilled athlete whether or not they make it onto the 
podium. 9.63 seconds or 12.6 seconds is truly impressive.
