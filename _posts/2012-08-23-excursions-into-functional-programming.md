The more that I've heard about functional programming, the more
I've been intrigued. Recently, I began playing around with Haskell
and working my way through <a href='http://learnyouahaskell.com/'>Learn You a Haskell</a>.
(I know, I know. I'll check out Erlang, too.)

Discovering list comprehensions in Haskell made me, dare I say, giddy!
I've occasionally used list comprehensions in Python. However, I love 
that the syntax for list comprehensions in Haskell mimics set comprehensions 
exactly. Beautiful, straightforward syntax! So far, I have used Haskell to 
solve a few Project Euler problems and am enjoying the exercise in lambda calculus.
My foray into functional programming is just beginning. It should be interesting
to watch my thoughts develop.
