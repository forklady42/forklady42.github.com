Radiolab is easily my favorite podcast. I love listening to Robert and Jad muse about the universe and human nature and learning about various facets of science and philosophy. Thus I was thrilled last night to attend Radiolab Live: In the Dark.

Sight is the perfect theme for a live show of a radio broadcast.
Radio only allows for sound, while the live show allows Robert and
Jad to play around with visual effects.
Jad even joked in the show about how it is always odd for studio 
audiences to see radio hosts and that their initial reaction is 
"That's not what your voice looks like!"

Like a regular podcast, the show featured three segments all on different
aspects of sight. The show began by walking through the evolution of the
eyeball, a complex organ that troubled Darwin (Chuck D, as his friends or
at least Jad call him) and his contemporaries. How could such a complex 
organ evolve gradually? What good is only half an
eye? Or just a thousandth of an eye? 

After considering the evolution of eyes,the show discussed the loss of 
sight in the case of two men both of whom completely lost their 
sight as young adults. However, each of them coped quite differently. 
I found how they visualized their families quite interesting, as my 
mother was diagnosed with a retinal disease shortly after she became
pregant with me. At that stage, it was unclear how quickly the disease
would progress and whether or not she would be able to see me. Thankfully
with the aid of surgeries,she still had her sight nine months later when
I was born and can still see me now.

During the final piece of the show, Robert and Jad share an interview
with an astronaut about his extreme experience with light and dark.
The ending of which is stunning, simply beautiful and would not have
been possible over the radio.
