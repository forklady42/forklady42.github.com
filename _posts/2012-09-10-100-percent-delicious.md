Today, my friend Jaime and I toured the Theo Chocolate factory 
in Seattle. Theo is the first organic and fair trade bean-to-bar 
chocolate maker in the US, and makes delectable chocolate and 
confections. Given Jaime's and my penchant for science and chemistry 
we had all sorts of questions about the chocolate making process.

One of our main questions was about the difference between dark 
and milk chocolate. In the US, to be listed as chocolate a
confection must only be 10% cocao, and it must be over 36% to 
be listed as a dark chocolate. 36% isn't very high given that 
I generally think of upwards of 70% for dark chocolate. However,
Jaime's and my central question wasn't about the cut off points. 
Instead, we wanted to know they determined the percentage. Was it 
by mass or volume? Our guide wasn't able to tell us, but we noticed 
that when mixing the chocolate with nuts, the chocolatier carefully 
massed the ingredients. Mass makes sense for solids. Of course,
most ingredients, including the cocoa, sugar and milk are mixed as 
liquids. Still, mass percent made sense to Jaime and me. Thus,
in a 100g milk chocolate bar with 30% cocao, 30g are the actual 
chocolate while the other 70g are sugar, milk, vanilla, and additional
add ins. Doesn't seem very chocolaty does it?

The one treat that I took with me when we left: cocoa nibs--pieces
of the roasted, broken apart cocoa beans. They're 100% cocao. No confusion
there.
