"So you're going to do computer programming. Hmm. I guess 
I programmed computers when I worked at IBM."

Yes, Nana, you did. 

<hr />
She dropped out of college when Pearl Harbor was attacked.
Figured that she would be more help working. Plus, her 
brother  wouldn't need to loan her any more money for
her education.

The Minnesotan farm bureau where she had worked in accounting 
for a year before college offered to teach her keypunching.
Off she went to Minneapolis. After she'd been working there 
for a while, Lee, who was in charge of running the IBM machine, 
left, and she took his place. Mostly, she simply ran cards 
through, creating invoices based on whatever the clients had 
ordered. However, there were also times when the protocol was 
changed and the computer had a different mission. Then, she 
moved the wires around, plugging them into different holes to 
create new connections and tell the computer what to do. Eventually,
she left Minneapolis for Columbus where she programmed more 
IBM circuitboards.

Yes, Nana, that certainly counts as computer programming. Nowadays, 
I'd say I have it easier. Instead of manipulating physical wires,
I simply type commands into the computer using languages that more 
and more mimic natural languages. I find it much clearer than when 
I used circuitboards in electricity and magnetism labs in college.

And Nana, it's pretty cool that at 92 you use your computer to
still coordinate the flowers every Sunday for your church. Clearly, 
my knack for computers runs in the family.
