excerpt: The first four weeks of Hacker School are over. As with many experiences, part of me wonders where the time has gone, while the rest feels like I've been here for months. Already, I've become comfortable with Erlang, learned about socket programming (including building a simple game server and auction game), and gained a much better understanding of parsing by working on a JavaScript interpreter.

The first four weeks of Hacker School are over. As with many experiences, 
part of me wonders where the time has gone, while the rest feels 
like I've been here for months. Already, I've become comfortable with
Erlang, learned about socket programming (including building <a href="https://github.com/raysohn/bake"> a simple game server and auction game</a.), and gained a much better understanding 
of parsing by working on a JavaScript interpreter.

One awesome aspect of Hacker School is learning from the incredible 
programmers who are residents this batch.
A couple of weeks ago, residents Jessica McKellar and Alex Payne led us in an excercise 
brainstorming our fears about programming. The ranged from pairing 
with engineers more experienced than us to diving into large code bases
to "flossing"--those things that we know we should do but often don't, such as documentation
and tests.

Their point was that these are things that we should concentrate on 
learning. Many of us have goals of taking up new languages, learning about
concurrency, and implementing data structures. These are all great and important goals. 
It is important to know what we want to learn, where we want to explore.
Yet, not knowing that one hip language doesn't hinder us as much 
as our fear of asking for help or taking on a project because we 
think its beyond us. Knowing how to jump into other people's code 
and learn from those around us will get us farther than any one
specific skill. If we know how to take advantage of resources and 
learn on the go, then we'll

I still have specific goals for Hacker School: becoming better at Python,
contributing to open source projects, understanding how things work at 
a lower level. But on top of all of these and through all of my projects,
I want to become better at chatting about my work with others.
I want to learn about areas of computing that I've never even considered before.
I want to finish the projects that I start and become a better programmer.
