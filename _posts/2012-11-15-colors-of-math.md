    "To most people math appears abstract, mysterious. Complicated. Inaccessible. 
    But math is nothing but a different language to express the world. Math can 
    be sensual. Math can be tasted, it smells, it creates sound and color. One 
    can touch it - and be touched by it..."

Last weekend, I attended a screening of <i>Colors of Math</i>, a documentary 
about mathematicians and how they experience at the Imagine
Science Film Festival.

My favorite of the featured matematicians was Cedric Villani, a Fields Medalist 
studying the Boltzmann equation. When he begins sketching on the chalkboard, he 
clearly believes that he is working on the most interesting 
problem in the world. Villani has a vibrant personality, enjoying deep thinking, judging student
baking competitions and casting out jokes about mathematicians, much the way I imagine Feynman.

Watch the trailer to get a taste, scent, sight, whisper, feeling of math:

If that trailer didn't sell you, then I don't how to explain the beauty of math to you.
