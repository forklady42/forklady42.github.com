title: Will you apply to Hacker School?
published: true
comments: true
excerpt: 
    Of all the things I learned in college, what continues
    to stand out the most to me is that 
    <a href=http://sheshouldrun.org/>women do not run for public office unless they are asked</a>. 
    My hypothesis is that this applies not only to public office but to many other opportunities.
    Capable women won't necessarily apply for a position unless 
    someone requests them to.

    A week ago, I finished Hacker School. Without my sister's encouragement,
    I may not have applied. Several of the other women in my batch mentioned 
    their partner's or friend's support in their dicision to attend Hacker School.

Hacker School is committed to helping you discover how to become the 
best possible programmer that you can be.
Being the best programmers possible involves being our best selves.
You don't leave your other passions out. Instead, you choose projects 
that use your other interests. You might be a knitter and
 build an app to convert an image into a pattern, or a designer who
sees art in the low level implementations of a language. 
Maybe you're a mathematician and find anonymous functions so
intriguing that you write a lambda calculus interpreter.

If Hacker School has been sitting in the back of your mind, do yourself
and the next batch of Hacker Schoolers a favor and apply. No matter 
your background, you too have something to offer and something to learn.
If you're intellectually curious, get excited by coding 8 hours a day,
and dedicated to improving as a programmer, there's a place for you at
Hacker School.

I am incredibly grateful to Etsy for making it possible for me to  
be a part of the fall batch and to the facilitators, Nick, Dave, Sonali, Alan, Tom, 
Allison, and Zach for poring so much of themselves into Hacker School.
I'll miss the conversations comparing special relativity to lamport clocks,
cheerful teasing about emacs vs. vim, and friends showing off their projects.
(And of course, I'll especially miss the first table of Room 620.)

Go email your partner, sister, friend, who would benefit from Hacker School.
Tell her to apply. Don't let her pass this opportunity by.
