I am Betsy Cannon, a recent graduate of <a href="http://www.carleton.edu">Carleton College</a>,
currently completing a year of service in Seattle through <a href="http://www.lutheranvolunteercorps.org/">Lutheran Volunteer Corps</a>.
I enjoy nerding out about physics, higher education access, and the electric grid.
Oh, and I collect <a href="/forks.html">forks</a>.
