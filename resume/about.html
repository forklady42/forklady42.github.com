<!--h3>Data, numbers, woohoo!</h3-->

<p>I'm a recent physics graduate from Carleton College, who believes
that math is absolutely beautiful. I'm excited to use the power and
beauty of math and technology to confront challenges, such as education
access and environmental crises, and to contribute to an increasingly 
awesome world. </p>
